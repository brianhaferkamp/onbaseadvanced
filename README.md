# On Base Advanced (OBA)
_On Base Advanced_ is the advanced version of the tabletop baseball game, _On Base Baseball_. Where the original game is a quick play version with outcomes right on the cards, the advanced version takes an opposite tact. There are _no predetermined outcomes_ anywhere in the game. Instead, through a series of rolls each roll outcome gets the gamer closer to the final outcome of the at bat.

The best way to learn the game is to play it. First, download these files:

- [2019 New York Mets](https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/onbaseadvanced/raw/main/OBA_2019_Mets.pdf)
- [On Base Advanced Guide](https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/onbaseadvanced/raw/main/On%20Base%20Advanced%20Guide.pdf)
- [Fielding Matrix (Bifold)](https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/onbaseadvanced/raw/main/OBA_Fielding_Matrices_Bifold.pdf)
- [Fielding Matrix (Trifold)](https://github.com/brianhaferkamp/onbaseadvanced/raw/main/OBA_Fielding_Matrices_Trifold.pdf)

Then read through the _On Base Advanced Guide_ to learn how each roll works and what values you should be using to compare against dice rolls. You'll need 2 D10 dice of different colors to play the game. You can use traditional dice or an online roller. Either work fine. Here is an [online dice roller that I made for this game](https://brianhaferkamp.github.io/onbaseadvanced/dice/) that you can use for free.
